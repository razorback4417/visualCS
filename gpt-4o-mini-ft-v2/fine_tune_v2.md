# Prompt
Create a Merge Sort Visualization using Manim
Create an educational animation of the Merge Sort algorithm using the Manim Python library. The visualization should demonstrate both the recursive division and merging processes through a simple, clear visual representation.
Initial Setup

Create a class inheriting from Scene named MergeSortVisualization
Initialize an unsorted array of 8 integers (e.g., [7, 3, 1, 8, 4, 2, 6, 5])
Represent each number in a square:

Fixed-size squares (1.0 units)
Number centered inside square
Initial color: WHITE with slight transparency
Small spacing between squares (0.2 units)



Visual Layout Requirements

Position initial array centered at y=2
Maintain consistent spacing between squares
Reserve vertical space below (y < 2) for recursive divisions
Keep all elements within camera frame (-7 ≤ x ≤ 7, -4 ≤ y ≤ 4)

Animation Sequence

Array Initialization (2-3 seconds)

Fade in squares with numbers
Add title "Merge Sort Visualization" at top
Brief pause to show initial state


Division Phase

Create clear splitting animations:

Move subarrays down by 1.5 units
Shift left/right subgroups horizontally
Add dotted lines connecting parent to child arrays
Duration: ~1 second per split




Merging Phase
For each merge comparison:

Highlight comparing squares in blue
Move smaller number up first
Return color to white after comparison
Remove original squares after merging


Final Steps

Color final sorted array green
Display "Array Sorted!" text
Hold final state for 2 seconds



Technical Notes

Use consistent animation timings (0.5-1.0 seconds per action)
Add appropriate pauses between steps
Group square and number as single mobject
Track and update positions carefully during merges
Importantly, make sure no objects get in the way of each other, and that all objects are visible in the screen
