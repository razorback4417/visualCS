I'd like the pie chart to have corresponding colors to these options, a legend to identify the colors, and a title at the top that says \"Favorite Colors Survey Results\". The colors should be a light blue for Sky, a light purple for Lavender, and a dark green for Forest. Additionally, I want the chart's background to be a cream color, the text to be a dark gray, and the start angle of the pie chart to be at the top or 90 degrees. Can the pie pieces have a slight transparency as well? Please place the legend at the bottom of the chart."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\\n from manim import *\n\nclass TripleIntegralExample(Scene):\n    def construct(self):\n        # Displaying the problem\n        problem = MathTex(r\"\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\int_{-2}^{2} xyz \\,dz\\,dy\\,dx\")\n        self.play(Write(problem))\n        self.wait(1)\n\n        # Explanation for inner integral\n        explanation1 = Text(\"First, integrate with respect to z\", font_size=24).to_edge(UP)\n        self.play(Write(explanation1))\n        self.wait(2)\n\n        # Inner integral step\n        inner_integral = MathTex(r\"= \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{-1}^{1} [\\frac{1}{2}xyz^2]_{-2}^{2} \\,dy\\,dx\")\n        self.play(ReplacementTransform(problem.copy(), inner_integral))\n        self.wait(1)\n\n        # Explanation for middle integral\n        explanation2 = Text(\"Next, integrate with respect to y\", font_size=24).to_edge(UP)\n        self.play(Transform(explanation1, explanation2))\n        self.wait(2)\n\n        # Middle integral step\n        middle_integral = MathTex(r\"= \\int_{0}^{1} [\\frac{1}{2}xy^2z^2]_{-1}^{1} \\,dx\")\n        self.play(ReplacementTransform(inner_integral, middle_integral))\n        self.wait(1)\n\n        # Explanation for outer integral\n        explanation3 = Text(\"Finally, integrate with respect to x\", font_size=24).to_edge(UP)\n        self.play(Transform(explanation1, explanation3))\n        self.wait(2)\n\n        # Outer integral step and final solution\n        final_solution = MathTex(r\"= [\\frac{1}{6}x^3y^2z^2]_{0}^{1}\", r\"= \\frac{1}{6}\")\n        self.play(ReplacementTransform(middle_integral, final_solution))\n        self.wait(1)\n\n        # Clear the scene and conclude\n        self.clear()\n        self.wait(1)\n        self.play(Write(final_solution))\n        self.wait(1)"}]}
